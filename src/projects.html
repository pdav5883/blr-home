      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>The links below will take you to the code for each project. Use the menu above to navigate to the actual project.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/pdav5883/blr-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blr-home</a></h3>
      <p>The thing you are looking at right this moment. This is a static website, meaning that your browser always gets the same thing when you navigate to the site (until I update the files themselves). Static sites are pretty limited, but also super easy to host so the simplicity pays off.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/pdav5883/sat-finder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sat-finder</a></h3>
      <p>A web app to find visible satellites in the night sky with your phone. Pulls data from the public satellite catalog maintained by Space Force to determine satellite locations, then uses your phones sensors to help you point to ones that are visible.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/pdav5883/web-salad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web-salad</a></h3>
      <p>A pandemic-friendly version of Salad Bowl: the half-Taboo, half-Charades late night classic. Each player uses their phone to submit words into the virtual bowl, and when it is their turn receives a sequence of words that they have to make their team guess for points.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/pdav5883/bowl-pickem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bowl-pickem</a></h3>
      <p>Bowl season isn't quite as much fun as March Madness, but it's still an opportunity for a low stakes friends and family competition. Keeping Non-Playoff Bowls relevant since 2014.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/pdav5883/bracket-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bracket-revival</a></h3>
      <p>March Madness, but more confusing and fun than you're used to. After every round, re-pick your bracket so that you've always got a clean slate and your bracket is never busted. Better to be right in your original bracket though, since that will win you more points.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/pdav5883/budget-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget-tracker</a></h3>
      <p>Another small web app to track spending across months and categories. Apps like this are everywhere, but this is the only one that almost certainly won't sell my data to third parties. Uses an API called Plaid to pull credit card transactions, and several AWS services to store and visualize them.</p>
