      <h2>About the Author</h2>
      <p>My name is Peter, I am an engineer that enjoys building things and understanding how things work. Space systems are where I have spent most of my professional/academic time and I think they're great, but I acknowledge that there are other cool things out there in the world - engineered and otherwise. I love playing sports, though between a pandemic and having a kid I don't do nearly as much of that as I used to. I also love learning new things, with a list of topics I want to learn about that grows faster than my learning rate.</p>

      <p>I built this website to 1) learn how to build a website (conclusion: formatting in CSS should be left to professionals), and 2) serve as a home for some of my more interesting projects. It's been pretty fun, and has absolutely followed the Pareto principle that 80% of my effort has gone into generating 20% of the content.</p> 

      <p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-davison-28a6247b/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pdav5883">GitHub</a>. If you're not already a friend or family member and want to connect, send me a message and tell me how you found this website - I'm really interested.</p>
