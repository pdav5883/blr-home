      <h2>Why <em>bearloves.rocks?</em></h2>
      <p>If you're here, you're wondering why this site has such a strange name. Unless you've tried to come up with a website name yourself since 2014, you probably didn't even know that <em>.rocks</em> was an option (there are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">ton</a> of top-level domains).</p>

      <p>Among the many wonderful things that my wife brought to the relationship when we met in 2015 was a very fluffy, handsome, and quirky German Shepherd named Bear.</p>

      <p class="afterimage"> Among Bear's many quirks (others included going backwards through unfamiliar doors and fear of turtles) was an obsession with gathering rocks from under water when we took him swimming. To be clear, these were not pebbles in a puddle. The dog who would hide behind all possible obstacles during bath time would plunge his whole head underwater for several seconds and emerge with a softball-sized rock that he would haul ashore before returning for his next prize.</p>

      <p class="afterimage">As I was attempting to think of a clever name for my personal site, I saw that the <em>.rocks</em> top-level domain was an option and thus <em>bearloves.rocks</em> was born.</p>

      <p>We said goodbye to Bear in March 2021 after a life full of adventures and happy memories with his people. We miss him and his goofy rock collecting every day.</p>
